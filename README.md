In this project, I parsed HTML and used regular expressions to extract course information from a schedule, read course catalog data, merge both datasets, and address anomalies. Additionally, I retrieved and analyzed data from a Studio Ghibli API, creating a report with directors' names, the average Rotten Tomatoes scores, and the number of films directed by each.
